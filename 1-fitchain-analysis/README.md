## 1. Introduction
This research investigates the following issues of fitchain:

* evaluate Ocean/fitchain integration to determine any "gaps";
* identify capabilities that fitchain can enable (now vs. future);
* deep dive into fitchain Gossiper network to determine applicability (if any) to Ocean;
* research possible model validation methods post fitchain training.

At this time, the connection between Ocean and Fitchain has not been established. They are two independent work separated from each other now. More work need to be done to integrate them together.

## 3. Fitchain Architecture

The overall fitchain architecture is illustrated as below and includes several modules:

* **POD**: the off-chain component that orchestrates communication and data-model access among the actors of the fitchain platform.
* **Fitchain smart contracts**: on-chain smart contract implementation of Fitchain logics.
* **Gossiper network**: the off-chain Kademlia P2P network which replay log messages of model training among gossiper nodes.
* **Verifier netwokr**: the off-chain component where verifier nodes validate model accuracy using the new validation dataset from Ocean.

## 4. Deep Dive into Modules

### 4.1 POD and Fitchain Smart Contracts

* POD is an off-chain component deployed on both Data Provider and Data Scientist sides. It provide interface to all external components including:

	* User interface: dashboard and CLI.
	* Interaction with blockchain & Smart Contract: ethereum, EOS, etc.
	* Storage: IPFS, AWS S3, etc.
	* Data scheme extraction from raw data.
	* ...

* Data provider registers a project in fitchain network (i.e., smart contract) and releases the data scheme in IPFS storage (hash address is published on-chain).

* Data scientist can apply for a project, compose a model based on data scheme in the local, and submit the model to Data Provider for training.

### 4.2 Gossiper Network

* When running the training on the model, **POD** on the data provider side will emit log messages to the Gossiper network as a sequence of messages.

* A `gossiper channel` will be created in smart contract for a specific training project. A subset of gossiper nodes will be randomly chosen and registered in this gossiper channel.

* Each gossiper node that receives an message will broadcast to its neighboring nodes. Therefore, all gossiper nodes will be synced with log messages. 

<img src="img/gossiper_network.jpg" width=800 />


* Each message will become final after a certain number (i.e., k = 3) of gossipers can confirm it. After all messages become final, the training process proves to be complete.

* Merkle root hash of received messaged will be computed to ensure all gossiper nodes receive the same log messages. In the end, each gossiper needs to submit merkle root hash with own signature to Fitchain smart contract.

* Gossiper network can **verify the completeness of training process** without knowing its accuracy.

**Concern of Fraudulent Attack:**

Is that possible the gossiper network is susceptible to fraudulent attacks due to malicious gossiper node? 

* one malicious gossiper node may generate fake log messages in its local and broadcast to its neighbors. 
* over the time all nodes in the gossiper network will receive this fake message. 
* once several gossipers confirm this fake log message, it becomes final and attack is successful.   

Suggestion:

* when POD in data provider side emits log messages, it should send signature along with the message.
* each gossiper who receives a new log message should verify the corresponding signature before confirm it. 
* it is better to add this layer of security protection if there is no any.


### 4.3 Verifier Network

* Verifier network aims to validate the accuracy of model using new dataset from Ocean.

* The original training data is not accessible to verifiers, therefore, they need to find new dataset which is similar to training data to validate the model accuracy. 

* Each verifier submits own validation result in a commit-reveal process to the Fitchain smart contract. 

* When a certain number (i.e., k = 3) of verifiers can validate the model accuracy, the result becomes final and Fitchain can update the Ocean about model accuracy.

## 5. Ocean and Fitchain Integration

**Assumption**: 

* *Ocean keeper and Fitchain contracts are deployed in different network.* (e.g., Ocean keeper is deployed in Ocean POA network, while Fitchain contracts deployed in Ethereum or its own POA network, etc.).
* *Model validation is done by verifiers in Fitchain network*. 

<img src="img/integration.jpg" width=1000 />

* **Ocean Keeper**: it should interact with Fitchain network through the Bridge contract including:
	* dispatch training job along with token payment/reward;
	* receive data scheme from Fitchain to search for new validation dataset;
	* store validation data in IPFS and send address hash to Fitchain;
	* receive validated model from Fitchain and fulfill the service condition;
* **Bridge contract**ï¼šit should be deployed in both networks to:
	* emit messages to off-chain validators;
	* collect required number of signatures in order to trigger transactions;
	* verify the received signatures from validators;
	* manage the registry of validators (e.g., add, remove, etc.);
	* transfer token payment or reward to Fitchain for the training job.
* **Off-chain Validators**: it can relay the messages across networks:
	* it listens to the event messages emitted from both networks;
	* verify the messages and generate own signature;
	* relay message along with signature to the other network;
	* transfer tokens across the network.
* **Fitchain Smart Contract**: it should launch training and validate models:
	* execute training process in the local of data providers;
	* gossiper network should verify the completeness of training process;
	* should find validation dataset from Ocean to validate the model;
	* verifier network should run validation on the trained model & validation dataset;
	* return the trained model to Ocean through Bridge to fulfill the service condition. 


## 6. Current Implementation Status

### 6.1 Ocean - Keeper Contract:

Current implementation (i.e., fitchain service condition) is a very early-stage prototype and has no interaction with Fitchain network.

	* register as a verifier of model validation (but staking and slashing are not available now)
	* select K verifiers for model validation using round-robin (for load balancing purpose). 
	* change the condition status (i.e., boolean variables) to fulfill the service condition.
* **Need to do:**
	* should dispatch training jobs to Fitchain network;
	* receive the model from Fitchain and *find validation dataset in Ocean*;
	* return validation dataset to Fitchain network;
	* fufill the service condition with validated model;
	* need bridge contract to communicate with Fitchain network.
	* transfer Ocean tokens to Fitchain as payment or reward.

	* staking functions such as stake, slash, and release stakes: [FitchainStake.sol](https://github.com/fitchain/fitchain-contracts/blob/master/contracts/FitchainStake.sol)
* **Need to Do:**
	* should register project upon receiving training jobs from Ocean (at this time, data provider registers project);
	* should send trained model to Ocean when gossiper network verifies the proof of training;
	* verifier network should validate model using the validation dataset from Ocean network;
	* should return validated model to Ocean in order to fulfill service condition.
	* it needs bridge contract to communicate with Ocean network.
	

### 6.3 Fitchain gossiper network

	* verifier access validation data & model and run off-chain validation. [verify.py](https://github.com/fitchain/verifier/blob/master/verify.py)
* **Need to Do:**
	* verifier should be able to access validation dataset from Ocean;
	* the validation can be monitored by gossiper network to generate proof of validation;
	* verifiers should submit validation results as votes to validate models.

## 7. Investigation of Issues

### 7.1 determine any gaps in Ocean/fitchain integration:

*  Most important issue is finding validation dataset from Ocean
	*  it remains unknown how to find new validation dataset from Ocean;
	*  it is unclear how Ocean can guarantee the validation data is similar to training data.
*  bridge contract that emits messages and collects signatures is not available.
*  off-chain bridge component relaying Fitchain messages to Ocean is not available.
*  token transfer from Ocean to Fitchain is not available (i.e., service payment, reward).
*  Ocean fitchain condition contract is not complete. Many functionalities need to be added:
	*  dispatch training jobs to Fitchain;
	*  explore validation dataset for a trained model;
	*  return validation data to Fitchain;
	*  verify the validation from Fitchain to fulfill the service condition.
*  Ocean needs utility component to store and access the dataset & model in IPFS.
*  Fitchain needs to add more functionalities in contracts, gossiper network and verifier network as described in the above.


### 7.2 Fitchain Capability:

* fufill the computing service conditions where training of models are requested.
* resolve the dispute of trained model accuracy, since verifier network can validate the model accuracy.
* verify completeness of any workflow process with gossiper network in a decentralized manner.

### 7.3 Gossiper network capability:

* verify completeness of off-chain training process in a decentralized manner.
* however, it shall not be used to relay the on-chain messages across blockchain networks.
	* gossiper node needs to verify the signature of the message to prevent fraudulent attacks;
	* on-chain smart contract cannot sign any message to generate signatures.
	* only the externally owned account who owns private key can generate signature.
	* therefore, gossiper node cannot validate the on-chain log messages received from its peers.
